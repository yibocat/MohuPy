def deriv(e, sub, func, *args):
    """
        Derivative of a fuzzy measure function(derivatives of set functions).
            The notion of discrete derivatives can be seen as a basis for determining
            the contribution of inputs to various coalitions, as well as for observing
            interaction effects.
            The function can be seen as a derivative of x to the fuzzy measure function
            at subset.

        Parameters
        ----------
            e : list or float or np.float64 or np.ndarray
                Elements or subsets to be differentiated
            sub : list or float or np.float64 or np.ndarray
                The subset to be differentiated
            func : function
                The fuzzy measure function
            args : list or np.ndarray
                The fixed sets.
        Returns
        -------
            np.float64
            The derivative of an element or subset with respect to the subset under
                a fixed set

        Examples
        --------
            1.  In [1]: deriv([0.4,0.25],[0.4,0.25,0.37,0.2], mp.lambda_meas, [0.4,0.25,0.37,0.2])

def shapley(e, func, *args):

        Shapley value of a set. The Shapley value is interpreted as a kind
            of average value of the contribution of each criterion alone in
            all coalitions. The Shapley value is the vector of the average
            marginal. One important property of the Shapley value is that
            the sum of the vector is 1.

        Parameters
        ----------

        An alternative to the Shapley value is the Banzhaf value. It measures the same
